# Spinning Wheel App

This Flutter project implements a customizable spinning wheel feature, ideal for games, random selections, or decision-making tools. The project demonstrates advanced state management, weighted random selection, and responsive layouts.

## Features

- **Spinning Wheel**: A visually appealing wheel of fortune that selects items randomly.
- **Weighted Probability**: Items on the wheel can have weighted probabilities, allowing some options to appear more frequently than others.
- **Responsive Design**: Supports both portrait and landscape orientations.
- **Audio Integration**: Plays a dynamic spinning sound that slows down as the wheel stops.
- **Localizations**: Multi-language support for UI elements.
- **State Management**: Utilizes the Bloc pattern for clean and scalable architecture.
